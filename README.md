# Restaurant Framework
Framework for the restaurant application and server using .NET 4.5 C# and Entity Framework 6+

Restaurant Management Application Framework

## Notes

Look into using iPod touch as a touch screen device

## Libraries

Data - Contains the data models and is used by every application

DataAccess - Contains mapping for Entity Framework and Data context

Listeners - Packet listeners for the TCP side of the server

Service - provides access to the data used by the web site and server

Network - provides applications with access to the framework through serialiazable packets

Server - Main application for hosting, can be installed as a console application or a web service

ServiceHost - Used for hosting web services with IIS (Doesn't allow TCP)

Web - ASP.NET Web site

Android - Android application

iOS - iPhone/iPad application

Windows - Windows phone/tablet application

Common - A library of helpers classes and extensions

Use `ServiceHost` to host the web services in the server, example:

``` C#
// Host the service within this EXE console application. 
public static void Main()
{
  using (ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService)))
  {
    try
    {
      // Open the ServiceHost to start listening for messages.
      serviceHost.Open();

        // The service can now be accessed.
      Console.WriteLine("The service is ready.");
      Console.WriteLine("Press <ENTER> to terminate service.");
      Console.ReadLine();

      // Close the ServiceHost.
      serviceHost.Close();
    }
    catch (TimeoutException timeProblem)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(timeProblem.Message);
      Console.ReadLine();
    }
    catch (CommunicationException commProblem)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(commProblem.Message);
      Console.ReadLine();
    }
  }
}

//http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/650869/Creating-a-Self-Hosted-WCF-Service
// Create the ServiceHost.
using (ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(HelloWorldService), baseAddress))
{
    // Enable metadata publishing.
    ServiceMetadataBehavior smb = new ServiceMetadataBehavior();
    smb.HttpGetEnabled = true;
    smb.MetadataExporter.PolicyVersion = PolicyVersion.Policy15;
    host.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb);

    // Open the ServiceHost to start listening for messages. Since
    // no endpoints are explicitly configured, the runtime will create
    // one endpoint per base address for each service contract implemented
    // by the service.
    host.Open();

    Console.WriteLine("The service is ready at {0}", baseAddress);
    Console.WriteLine("Press <Enter> to stop the service.");
    Console.ReadLine();

    // Close the ServiceHost.
    host.Close();
}

```

Fix this error: The communication object, System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost, cannot be used for communication because it is in the Faulted state. Run as a fucking admin... update the manifest

~~The server can be hosted as an .exe or a windows service which will start and stop when the computer is shutdown and restarted.~~

~~Butcher this in the App.Config to set up the service correctly~~ All the hosting is done neatly in code not through a config file. todo: maybe add own simpler config file once serialisation class has been fixed

``` XML
<system.serviceModel>
  <services>
    <service behaviorConfiguration="DefaultBehavior" name="Namespace.Service1">
      <endpoint address="" binding="netTcpBinding" bindingConfiguration="TCPBindingConfig" name="TCPEndpoint" contract="Namespace.IService1" />

## EF Notes
```
[MaxLength(100, "{0} can have a max of {1} characters")]
public string Address { get; set; }
```
Will output the following if it is over the character limit: "Address can have a max of 100 characters"

The placeholders I am aware of are:
```
{0} = Property Name
{1} = Max Length
{2} = Min Length
```

### Notes

Use WCF for data access and use websockets for push notifications such as updates and new data. This can be loosely based on the Network library.
